## React Folder Structure: Feature-based

This project uses a **feature-based structure** for React.

```txt
src/
  config/
    env.config.ts              # App-wide config, env variables

  features/
    <feature>/
      components/              # Components used only by this feature
      hooks/                   # Feature-specific hooks
      types.ts                 # Feature-specific types
      utils.ts                 # Feature-specific helpers
  pages/                       # mimic the routes that are organize by roles
    admin                      # contain pages that only admin can access
    user                       # page for user

  components/                  # shared components between features
  hooks/                       # Shared hooks used by many features
  lib/
    trpc.ts                    # tRPC client
    query-client.ts            # TanStack Query client
    utils.ts                   # Shared utilities

  styles/
    globals.css                # Global CSS / Tailwind imports

  App.tsx                     # Root app component
  main.tsx                     # Vite React entry point
  index.css                    # import tailwindcss
```

## Coding rules:

- Always use typescript & at strict mode
- Always use @trpc/client to call backend
